# AgentX — Design Brief (platform UI pass + marketing site)

> **Living direction — set 2026-07-10.** Futuristic/technical is the target;
> the earlier paper-and-ink look is out. Update only when the direction changes.

> For the design session. Self-contained: everything you need is in this file
> or at the file paths it names. Two workstreams — **A: marketing pages**
> (net-new) and **B: platform UI polish** (existing product). Deliver specs the
> engineering session can wire directly (formats at the bottom).

## 1. What AgentX is (positioning input)

AgentX is an **MCP-native backend platform**: an AI agent defines a project's
data model over MCP and instantly gets back (1) a **branded admin** the end
client works in, and (2) a **delivery API** the live site consumes. No
per-project backend code. Built by Currents Studio (an agency) — today it runs
their client sites; the trajectory is a multi-tenant platform where users bring
their own infrastructure as connectors (Clerk auth, Resend email, Stripe
payments) and agents do the building.

Capability inventory for marketing copy: [docs/CAPABILITIES.md](CAPABILITIES.md)
— 42 MCP tools, per-field public-read delivery API, authorization presets,
automation (events/schedules/workflows), Stripe checkout, before-write hooks
("your code on your infra — AgentX never hosts tenant code"), near-realtime
change feed, image transforms, per-field i18n, trash/versions safety net.

**Audience for marketing**: agencies and product developers who build client
sites *with AI agents* and are tired of hand-rolling a CMS + admin + API per
project. Secondary: the agency's own clients (they experience the admin, and
the marketing site sets expectations for what they were handed).

**Voice**: confident, technical, concrete. The platform's own design rules are
a good tone reference — "declarative + self-describing", "machine-readable
errors with fix hints", "destructive = plan + confirm". Anti-hype; show real
mechanics (tool calls, plans, diffs) rather than abstract AI promises.

## 2. Design direction — THIS IS A REBRAND

**The owner has decided to move away from the current look.** The incumbent
system ("paper-and-ink editorial": warm paper canvas, ink sidebar, Bricolage
Grotesque display type) is documented below only so you know what you're
replacing and what its wiring contract is. Do not extend it.

**Target direction: futuristic, technical, AI-native.**
**Primary reference: the Payload CMS website (payloadcms.com).** What we like
about it: dark-first, high-contrast, engineered feel — visible grid/hairlines,
monospace accents for technical truth (ids, tool names, code), restrained
near-monochrome palette with one sharp accent, generous negative space,
type-led rather than illustration-led, subtle purposeful motion. It looks like
a serious tool built by people who ship. AgentX's subject matter fits this
perfectly: MCP tool calls, schema diffs, plan+confirm flows ARE the visuals —
lean into rendering real mechanics (terminal-style tool-call snippets, schema
diffs, API responses) as first-class design elements.

Anchor on Payload as the reference point, but this must not read as a Payload
clone — find AgentX's own signature within that genre (one direction, not
three options).

**Scope of the rebrand**: marketing AND the platform admin — one system, two
registers. Dark-first is on the table for the admin too (owner is open to it);
decide and commit. Fonts are replaceable (next/font makes wiring trivial —
pick license-safe/open faces; a strong mono is essential to this direction).

### The incumbent (what you're replacing — wiring contract only)

Lives in [app/globals.css](../app/globals.css). The **class-name contract**
matters for wiring even after the rebrand: ~20 admin pages consume
`.card`, `.btn`, `.btn-primary`, `.btn-ink`, `.field-input`, `.chip-*`,
`.eyebrow`, `.display`, `.section-label`, `.richtext-editor`. Preferred:
keep these class NAMES and restyle their values wholesale (cheapest wiring).
If the new system genuinely needs a different vocabulary, deliver an explicit
old→new mapping and engineering will migrate.

Two hard invariants that survive the rebrand:
- `--brand`: each project injects an arbitrary client brand color into the
  admin at runtime — the new system needs explicit rules for where that color
  appears and how it stays legible on the new (likely dark) surfaces.
- **Stack**: Next.js App Router + Tailwind v4, server components by default.

## 3. Workstream A — marketing site (net-new)

Nothing exists today. **Build it with the information architecture of a real
platform company, not a single-page side project** — top-nav silos, hub pages,
and leaf pages, so the site scales as the platform opens up (multi-tenancy and
plugins are on the roadmap).

### Brand architecture (design for a rename, and for MULTIPLE products)

- **Company: "Pluggie" (WORKING NAME — explicitly not settled).**
- **Product 1: "AgentX"** — the flagship, shipping product (this codebase).
- **Product 2: "Hostile Agent"** — COMING SOON, not built (see §3.5). Its
  existence is why the company/product split is real, not premature: Pluggie
  is a multi-product company, AgentX and Hostile Agent are siblings under it.
- Design consequence: treat names as swappable tokens everywhere — logo
  lockups (company mark, per-product wordmarks, combined lockups), nav,
  footer, legal lines. Nothing may bake a name into artwork that can't be
  re-cut in minutes. Deliver the lockup system explicitly, and it must
  accommodate a **product family** (a nav/products menu, consistent
  "<Product> by Pluggie" treatment), not just one product.

### Sitemap / silo structure

```
/                         Landing (company-level: Pluggie, the product family)
/products                 Products index — AgentX (live) + Hostile Agent (soon)
/product                  AgentX hub — overview, how-it-works in 3 beats
  /product/data-modeling      schema registry, 8 primitives, branded admin
  /product/delivery-api       per-field public reads, query power, search, i18n
  /product/authorization      identity presets, BYO Clerk, org scoping
  /product/automation         events, schedules, declarative workflows
  /product/payments           Stripe checkout, order lifecycle
  /product/compute            before-write hooks, computed fields — "your code
                              on your infra; we never host it"
  /product/realtime           change feed + SSE
  /product/trust              trash/restore, versions, audit, plan+confirm
/solutions                Solutions hub — by use case, not by feature
  /solutions/agencies         hand-off-ready branded admins per client
  /solutions/ai-builders      agents build the backend over MCP end-to-end
  /solutions/content-sites    editorial/content delivery (i18n, media, search)
  /solutions/membership       gated content, member auth, owner rows
  /solutions/commerce         sellable collections, checkout, fulfillment
/hostile-agent            Hostile Agent — COMING SOON teaser page (§3.5)
/developers               Docs hub — MCP tool surface, generated TS client,
                          API conventions (E_* errors, ETags), hooks guide
/pricing                  Placeholder register ("early access" tier language —
                          no real pricing exists yet; design the pattern)
/company                  About (Currents Studio origin), contact
```

Note: the landing shifts to a COMPANY-level pitch (Pluggie makes tools for the
agent era) with AgentX as the lead product and Hostile Agent as the "what's
next" — because there are now two products, the top level can't be
AgentX-only. Design the products menu / family framing accordingly.

Leaf pages may launch as well-designed stubs — the SILOS and nav must be real
from day one; depth can fill in. Every capability claim must map to
[docs/CAPABILITIES.md](CAPABILITIES.md) — this structure makes us look
established, it must not make us look dishonest. Solutions pages describe use
cases the platform genuinely serves today.

### Page-level notes

- **Landing** — company-level hero (the platform pitch in one sentence),
  how-it-works in 3 beats (agent defines schema → branded admin appears →
  site consumes the API), capability grid, "built for agents" proof section
  (real tool-call transcript, self-describing errors, plan+confirm), CTA
  (request access — not self-serve until Phase 20).
- **Product leaves** — each: one crisp value statement, one real mechanic
  rendered as a visual (per §2), boundaries stated honestly (e.g. compute:
  "AgentX never hosts your code" is a FEATURE, market it as one).
- **/solutions/agencies** doubles as the "for your clients" page — what the
  handed-off branded admin looks like.

### 3.5 Hostile Agent — COMING SOON (teaser only, NOT built)

Second product under Pluggie. **Do not design a full product site — one
teaser/waitlist page + presence in the products menu.** It is not built and
won't be soon; the goal is to establish it as a real part of the family and
capture interest.

**What it is (for copy):** an autonomous **security-testing** agent you point
at your OWN application, API, or MCP server. It actively tries to do what it
shouldn't — bypass permissions, break business rules, chain tools dangerously,
exploit authorization gaps, exfiltrate data, trigger destructive actions, abuse
retries — and reports the vulnerabilities it finds. Red-teaming for the agent
era: the natural companion to AgentX (you build a backend with AgentX, then
prove it holds up with Hostile Agent).

**FRAMING GUARDRAIL (non-negotiable — brief the design session on this):** this
is a DEFENSIVE, authorized-testing tool. All copy and imagery must anchor on
"test YOUR systems / find gaps before attackers do / authorized security
assessment." It must never read as an attack-for-hire or a tool aimed at
systems you don't own. Think Burp Suite / pentest-platform positioning, not
"hacking as a service." Tone can be edgy (the name is deliberately sharp) but
the legitimacy frame is load-bearing — get it wrong and it's a liability.

Page contents: name + one-line definition, the threat classes it probes (the
list above, as a grid), the "authorized use only" frame, an email waitlist
CTA. No pricing, no fake screenshots, no dashboards — it doesn't exist yet.

Constraints:
- Lives in the same Next app under a `(marketing)` route group (default
  assumption — flag if you'd rather it be standalone).
- Marketing is where the new direction (§2) shows at full strength; the admin
  is its quieter, denser sibling — one recognizable system across both.
- Original illustrations/diagrams only; no stock-alike AI hero clichés
  (no glowing brains, no robot hands). Real mechanics as visuals: tool-call
  transcripts, schema diffs, plan/confirm exchanges, API payloads.
- Responsive down to 375px; static/server-rendered; no heavy JS libraries.
  Motion via CSS/small hand-rolled JS only.

## 4. Workstream B — platform UI pass (existing, never had a design pass)

The admin is a **client handoff artifact** — an agency hands it to their
client, so it must read as a polished product, not an internal tool. It has
never had a dedicated visual pass (roadmap item C5). Mobile and the TipTap
richtext editor are called out as the weakest spots.

Surfaces (all under [app/admin/](../app/admin/) + [components/](../components/)):

| Surface | Files | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Studio home (project list) | app/admin/page.tsx | project cards, connector health dots |
| Collection entry list | app/admin/[projectId]/[collection]/page.tsx | auto-generated table, quick search, CSV/JSON export, inbox "handled" affordance, pagination |
| Entry form | components/EntryForm.tsx, [entryId]/page.tsx, new/page.tsx | one input per field primitive; visibility pills (public/admin-only); locale switcher pills + "n/N translated" chips (NEW, never eyeballed); workflow-narrowed selects; read-only computed fields; TipTap richtext (components/RichtextInput.tsx); relation combobox; version-history + audit aside panel |
| Trash | .../trash | restore/purge with arm-to-confirm buttons |
| Media | .../assets | asset grid |
| Settings | .../settings | tokens, webhooks + delivery log (multi-shape: email/hook/stripe rows), members, manifest import/export, Automation (schedules pause/resume, jobs cancel) |
| Connectors | .../connectors | Clerk/Resend/Stripe cards: health dots, connect/rotate/disconnect, Stripe "provision webhook" |
| Appearance | .../appearance | branding (name/logo/color) |
| API reference | .../api | generated per-project docs |

Design goals, in priority order:
1. **Reskin to the new system (§2)**: this is not a polish pass on the old
   look — every surface moves to the new direction. The entry list + entry
   form are what clients live in; they should feel like a paid product.
   Keep the "teaching" empty states, raise the craft.
2. **Mobile**: sidebar is a drawer; forms and tables need real small-screen
   treatment, not just wrapping.
3. **Brand-color resilience**: every accent must survive an arbitrary client
   `--brand` value (including ugly ones) on the new surfaces — define usage
   rules (where brand color may/may not appear, contrast fallbacks). This
   gets HARDER on dark surfaces; solve it explicitly.
4. **The operator surfaces** (settings/connectors/automation) can be denser
   and more technical — the register where the mono/terminal voice of the
   new direction is most at home.

What NOT to change: form semantics and field behavior (inputs, hidden fields
like `__locale`, confirm-flows); information architecture of settings; any
functional class hooks. Visual/spacing/typography/state changes are all fair
game.

## 5. Deliverables (what engineering needs back)

1. **Direction**: one consolidated visual direction (not three options),
   Payload-anchored per §2 — moodboard + a FULL new token sheet (palette,
   type scale + chosen faces, spacing, radii, borders/hairlines, shadows,
   motion rules). Explicit decisions to make and state: dark-first for the
   admin yes/no; how `--brand` client colors behave on the new surfaces.
2. **Marketing pages**: high-fidelity mockups (HTML/Tailwind v4 preferred —
   they wire near-verbatim; Figma acceptable with a full handoff spec), all
   breakpoints for the landing page, copy included (or marked TODO-copy per
   block).
3. **Admin pass**: annotated redlines per surface in the table above —
   updated `globals.css` tokens/classes + before/after specs. Component-level
   states for: buttons (idle/hover/pending/armed-confirm), chips, table rows
   (+ unhandled badge), form fields (idle/error), empty states, TipTap
   toolbar, locale/visibility pills.
4. **Assets**: original SVG illustrations/diagrams for marketing, favicon/og
   treatment.

Format notes for the wiring session: Tailwind v4 utilities + the shared class
vocabulary (or an explicit old→new class mapping, see §2); new fonts fine via
next/font (state the faces + licenses); no new runtime deps without flagging;
every spec names the file it applies to.

## 6. Open questions (answer or decide-and-note)

1. Marketing CTA reality: "request access" vs "book a call" vs just a repo
   link — owner call (platform is not self-serve until Phase 20).
2. Naming: company working name is "Pluggie" (NOT settled), products are
   "AgentX" (live) and "Hostile Agent" (coming soon). Design rename-tolerant
   for the company name and for a growing product family (see §3, §3.5).
3. Same-app `(marketing)` route group vs separate site (default: same app).
4. Screenshots of the current admin for workstream B: the admin is auth-gated;
   ask the owner for a walkthrough/screens, or design from the component
   files listed above.
5. Admin dark-first: owner is open to it (Payload's own admin is dark-capable)
   — design should make the call and defend it, considering client-facing
   readability and the `--brand` injection.
